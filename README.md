Data Structures and Algorithms Quickbook, contains questions from [Striver's A2Z DSA Course Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)

A Good way to introduce importance of computational social sciences in real life. 

If you are going with the approach like “I will finish all array questions then I will move to another topic say Binary Search” then you are confusing these coding websites with books. 

Websites are designed according to SEO means “separate article for any searchable topic” and books are designed according to reader’s flow means “reader must not require to go beyond the book frequently in order to understand the fundamental concepts” 

If you try solving all questions of array then you’ll get stuck on array for a very long time because most questions are similar and the remaining 15-20% are those which nobody can solve optimally in one go as they are exceptions and they aren’t generally asked. 

If you don’t listen to experts in competitive coding then it might be possible that you develop impostor syndrome. You might feel other people are so smart that they possess some magical abilities to solve these exceptions just by intuition which is big lie.
